In Promtail config we will try to pending send data from promtail to loki when loki is unavailable
- Make batch wait 10 multiples more than default 1s. This means Promtail will send data every 10s instead of 1s
- Make batch size 10 multiples more than default size 10240 byte.
- When the param above, batch wait and batch size, is reached promtail will send using parameter value at backoff_config
- retries 10 looping, every trying has max period 5 minutes. Its mean the peak of period is 50 minutes
